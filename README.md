## FAQ

### Why not use Expo?
Expo is awesome, but as a native dev with experience in iOS and Android I often found myself fighting to keep my dependencies lean, and configurations easily accessible.

### Why use this boilerplate? There are a million others.
There are a ton of boilerplates for every tech stack under the sun. This boilerplate has a few unique features that I hadn't seen in others:
- Completely custom and readable babel, webpack, and metro configurations
- Native navigators for iOS and Android + web navigation intergration
- Typescript and SVG support preconfigured for all platforms
